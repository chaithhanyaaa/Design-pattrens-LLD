-> since we have only one type in Bmw that is bmw 
we did nt go for map here,other we would need to make 
all the classes for different types

-> if any new Car brand comes we just make a class that extends vehicle 
no need of if else or voilation of open closed principle.

-> if any new car brand comes we just need to make a new factory class
that implements VehicleFactory and override createVehicle method

-> here any new car comes Main does nt need to change because we are using 
factory provider to get the factory and factory provider is not changing because we are 
using map to store the factories.following 5th princliple that is Dependency inversion 
principle and 2nd princle that is open closed principle.
