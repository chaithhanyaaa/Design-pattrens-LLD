-> Goal:creating a new object just by cloning the existing object
because sometimes creating a new one is costly ,complex or requires lof setup

-> we usually in jdbc create a new connection for every request and closes immediatly
after the rqst is done,but that connection creation very complex
DriverManager.getConnection()
1. open socket
2. authenticate
3. handshake
4. create session

-> Does protype solves JDBC?
JDBC does NOT use Prototype pattern for Connection objects.
A DB connection cannot be cloned safely
Cloning would copy:transaction state,cursor state,session state
this would leads to corruption
-> so the solution is connection pooling


->Now image getting details from the db to create an object takes tyme ,so we just create an object by cloning the previous object and modify just what we want -so creation takes less time.
