before we created an object and stored in a map
if we call the same key twice we will same object
-> this is called single ton factory pattren
-> it is safe to use when class has no varibles
class Example
{
  public int add(int a,int b)
  {
    return a+b;
  }
}

-> here it is safe because we dont have any variables in the class but 
if we have variables then it is not safe to use single ton factory pattren
because if we call the same key twice we will get the same object and 
if we change the variable in one object it will change in another object also because they are same object.

so insted of store an object we stored the way to create the new 
object

that is with Supplier<T> interface
-> we no need to create that interface
interface Supplier<T>
{
  T get();
}
