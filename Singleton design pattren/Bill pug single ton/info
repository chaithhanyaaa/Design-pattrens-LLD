-> two threads at a time call getinstance class and sees
holder.instance which is not loaded yet so jvm locks the other 
threads internally without synchronization and loads the holder class and creates the instance and returns it to both threads 
and then the next time when any thread calls getinstance it will see the instance is already created and returns it without locking
