-> here we did not use any pattren
-> issues are with tight coupling means Youtube channel knows the users 
so if tommorrow any new user comes like premium users ,it may leads updation
of the YoutubeChannel class which violets the open closed principle
-> also we are just sending notifications to all the users ,some may not be clicked
the bell icon so we need to have diff kinda users like 
1.premium users
2.admin users
3.bellicom users
