before we had code in the factory like
if(type.equal("car"))
{
  //code
}
else if(type.equal("truck"))
{
  //code
}


what if in the future we want to add more vehicles like bike, 
bus etc. then we have to keep on adding more
 else if statements in the factory class which is not a good design.
So to avoid this we can use a map to store the vehicle types and their corresponding objects. 
This way we can easily add new vehicle types without modifying the factory class.
